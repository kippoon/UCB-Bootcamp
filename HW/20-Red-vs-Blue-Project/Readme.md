# HW 20 - Red vs Blue Project

Your submission should include two items:

  - The presentation prepared with your group. Be sure that all group members contribute, and are named in the document.
  - The one-page response to an interview question. See the [readme](../../Units/20-Red-vs.-Blue-Project/Activities/Day_3/Interview-Questions/README.md). This is an individual segment, so please work on your own!
