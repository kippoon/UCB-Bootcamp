    **Solution:** Looking at the second alert where the malware was likely downloaded, we can see `91.121.30.169`.


- What is the internal IP address that Snort is flagging for the ET Policy HTTP?

#### Now, move into the pcap file.

- What is the MAC Address of the internal computer involved?

    **Solution:** `Dell (14:fe:b5:d4:15:ca)`

    ![](Images/Mac_address.jpg)

- What is the host name of the internal machine?

    **Solution**: Filter for `DHCP` traffic using `bootp`. The host name is `Dunn-Windows-PC`

    - `bootp` stands for `bootstrap protocol`. It is the protocol that DHCP traffic uses. 
    - **Note** that you can also filter for DHCP using `udp.port eq 68` to filter for traffic on port 68.

- Filter the pcap file to show you the conversation between the two machines that were identified in the Snort alert.

    **Solution:** `http.request and ip.addr eq 91.121.30.169 and ip.addr eq 172.17.8.109`

- Can you confirm the date and time this issue occurred?

    **Solution:** Filtering on HTTP and IP addresses, we have a packet at `2019-01-28 16:49:17`

- How can you confirm if the Snort alert is accurate?

    **Solution:** Follow the TCP stream and see the binary download starting with 'MZ' and '!This program cannot be run in DOS mode.'

    **Solution:** You can see the GET request ends in `/actiV.bin`.

- Can you safely verify whether or not malware was downloaded?

    **Solution:** Using `File > Export Objects > HTTP` find the `actiV.bin` file and save it.

    - Run `md5sum actiV.bin` to get a hash of the file.

    - Search the hash at [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/#/home/search).

    - You can also search the offending IP address at Virus Total.

- Would you categorize this alert as a `False Positive` or a `True Positive`?

     **Solution:** We have verified that Malware was downloaded, so this is a `True Positive`.

- If this issue needs to be mitigated, what steps should be taken with the infected machine?

    **Solution:** The machine should be restored to a backup prior to this infection.

- What steps should be taken in regards to network security?

    **Solution:** Using Wireshark `Tools > ACL Rules`, we can get a rule for the offending IP:

    - `#IPv4 source address`

    - `iptables --append INPUT --in-interface etho --source 91.121.30.169/32 --jump DROP`

- Would you categorize this issue as a Web, Email or Network attack?

    **Solution:** This attack was carried out by the victim clicking on a malicious web link, so this is a `Web Attack`
